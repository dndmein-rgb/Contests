Problem: 3774. Absolute Difference Between Maximum and Minimum K Elements
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/absolute-difference-between-maximum-and-minimum-k-elements/
Difficulty: Easy
Contest: LeetCode Weekly Contest 480

Problem Summary:
Given an array nums and integer k, find the maximum sum of absolute differences
by selecting k pairs where each pair consists of the largest and smallest 
remaining elements.

Approach:
1. Sort the array to bring smallest elements to the front and largest to the back
2. Pair the smallest k elements with the largest k elements
3. Sum up all the differences: (largest - smallest) for each pair
4. This greedy approach gives optimal result since we want maximum differences

Example:
nums = [1, 2, 4, 9], k = 2
After sort: [1, 2, 4, 9]
Pairs: (1,9) and (2,4)
Answer: (9-1) + (4-2) = 8 + 2 = 10

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(1) - only using a few variables (sorting is in-place)

        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // nums[n-1-i] is the (i+1)th largest element
            // nums[i] is the (i+1)th smallest element
